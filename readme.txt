A Python program creates a timer that counts time in stages.
After the end of each stage, the timer voice informs you how much time is left until the end of remaining stages.
After the completion of all stages, a melody is sounded.
Melody is selected from *. MP3 and *.WAV MELODIES directories
The time of each stage and the number of stages are set in the program interface.
